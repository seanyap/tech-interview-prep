## Technical Interview Notes

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I created this repository to store the notes I find important while preparing for technical interviews. 

My goal is to have a central place where I can find all the notes I find helpful, instead of having to search and visit multiple websites each time when reviewing. I decided to use Jupyter notebook instead of using readme or python files because I think Jupyter notebook provides the best experience for typing and reading notes. 

Feel free to look around! If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to me! ðŸ˜„
